Daily supervision of Leonie Grafweg's Bachelor thesis, conducted under the academic supervision of Prof. Oliver Thomas and Enrico Kochon at Osnabrück University in collaboration with DFKI.

## Thesis Overview
This thesis focuses on the visualization of models of artificial neural networks in virtual reality. The work aims to create immersive and interactive visualizations that allow users to explore and understand the structure and functioning of neural networks in a more intuitive way. By leveraging virtual reality technology, the thesis seeks to enhance the educational experience for students and practitioners of artificial intelligence, providing a novel approach to learning about neural networks.

This thesis was later published as a paper at the Cognitive Science Student Journal: https://cogsci-journal.uni-osnabrueck.de/visualizing-deep-neural-networks-in-virtual-reality/
