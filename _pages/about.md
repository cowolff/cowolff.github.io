Welcome! I'm Cornelius Wolff, a PhD researcher at the [TRL Lab at the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI)](https://trl-lab.github.io/") and the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Madelon Hulsebos and Maarten de Rijke. My work centers on **Insight Retrieval from Structured Data**, in which I investigate AI models and pipeline that can deal with all kinds of structured data like databases, csv files etc. I'm furthermore deeply interested in **AI in education**. **In-Context Learning** and **efficient machine learning**.

### Research Interests
- Insight extraction from structured/tabular data  
- Small and interpretable language models  
- In-Context Learning outside of Natural Language Processing
- AI for education and learning personalization

### Education
- **PhD in Computer Science**, CWI & University of Amsterdam (2025â€“present)  
- **M.Sc. in Cognitive Science**, OsnabrÃ¼ck University (2021â€“2025, Overall Grade: 1.0, Thesis: 1.0)  
- **B.Sc. in Information Systems**, OsnabrÃ¼ck University (2018â€“2021, Overall Grade: 2.1, Thesis: 1.0)

### Recent Projects
- **SynthEddix** â€“ AI-powered personalized learning platform (Python, React Native)  
- **EBIMAS** â€“ Emergent behavior in multi-agent systems, RL in MuJoCo  
- **SNN Routing Optimization** â€“ Neuron placement for 3D neuromorphic hardware  
- **From Pixels to Actions** â€“ Visual feature extraction in RL environments  

### Selected Publications
- *How well do LLMs reason over tabular data, really?* (ACL TableRep Workshop 2025)  
- *GRASP: Benchmark for Multimodal Language Models* (IJCAI 2024)  
- *PictSure: Pretraining Embeddings Matters for In-Context Learning Image Classifiers* (arXiv 2025)  
- [See full publication list â†’](/publications/)

### Technical Skills
